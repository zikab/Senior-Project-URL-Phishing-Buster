This above video is a cropped, speeded up version of the actual demo.

We aimed to make the browsing experience more secure by provind the users a chance to double check if a URL is a phishing URL or not.
A lot of research was done, firstly we had to understand what differentiate phishing and none phishing URLs and collect these features then implement the artificial neural network then train it and test it and finally integrate the interface with the backend with the artificial neural network.

The team members were 4 people.
